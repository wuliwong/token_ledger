# TokenLedger

A double-entry accounting ledger for managing token balances in Ruby on Rails applications. Provides atomic transactions, idempotency, audit trails, and thread-safe operations.

## Features

- **Double-entry accounting** - Every transaction is balanced (debits = credits)
- **Atomic operations** - All-or-nothing transactions with automatic rollback
- **Thread-safe** - Pessimistic locking (`lock!`) on account rows prevents race conditions and overdrafts
- **Idempotency** - Duplicate transaction prevention using external IDs
- **Audit trail** - Complete transaction history with metadata
- **Reserve/Capture/Release** - Handle external API calls safely
- **Polymorphic owners** - Support multiple owner types (User, Team, etc.)
- **Balance caching** - Fast balance lookups with reconciliation tools

## Double-Entry Accounting Fundamentals

TokenLedger implements traditional double-entry accounting with explicit semantics.

### Core Invariants

1. **`ledger_entries.amount`** - Always a positive integer (never zero, never negative). Enforced by database CHECK constraint.
2. **`entry_type`** - Either `"debit"` or `"credit"` (no other values allowed). Enforced by database CHECK constraint.
3. **Balance Formula** - `balance = sum(debits) - sum(credits)` (asset-style accounting)
4. **Account Balance** - `LedgerAccount.current_balance` uses the same formula as `Balance.calculate`
5. **Integer-Only Amounts** - TokenLedger operates strictly on **positive integers**. If your tokens have decimal values (e.g., $10.50), you must store them in base units/cents (e.g., 1050) and format them in the view layer. Never use floats for financial amounts.

### Account Types and Normal Balances

**Accounting Perspective:** These accounts are modeled from the **token holder's perspective**. A User Wallet is treated as an **Asset** (the user owns the tokens). From the platform's perspective, user balances are technically liabilities, but for clarity and intuition, we model them as assets from the user's viewpoint.

**Asset accounts** (wallets, reserved): Normal balance is DEBIT (positive)
- Increase with debits
- Decrease with credits
- Examples: `wallet:user_123`, `wallet:user_123:reserved`

**Liability accounts** (sources): Normal balance is CREDIT (typically negative under debits-minus-credits)
- Increase with credits
- Decrease with debits
- Examples: `source:stripe`, `source:promo`
- Represents the system's liability to the token issuer

**Expense/Consumption accounts** (sinks): Normal balance is DEBIT (positive)
- Increase with debits
- Decrease with credits
- Examples: `sink:consumed`, `sink:refunded`
- Tracks where tokens have been spent/consumed

### Worked Examples

Each operation creates two balanced entries (debits = credits).

#### Deposit (100 tokens)

```ruby
TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(owner: user, amount: 100, description: "Token purchase")
```

**Entries created:**
```
Entry 1: Debit  wallet:user_123         100  (balance delta: +100)
Entry 2: Credit source:stripe           100  (balance delta: -100)
```

**Result:** User balance = 100, Source balance = -100 (liability to token issuer)

#### Spend (50 tokens)

```ruby
TokenLedger::Manager.spend(owner: user, amount: 50, description: "Service consumed")
```

**Entries created:**
```
Entry 1: Credit wallet:user_123         50   (balance delta: -50)
Entry 2: Debit  sink:consumed           50   (balance delta: +50)
```

**Result:** User balance = 50, Consumed = 50

#### Reserve (30 tokens)

```ruby
TokenLedger::Manager.reserve(owner: user, amount: 30, description: "Hold for API call")
```

**Entries created:**
```
Entry 1: Credit wallet:user_123         30   (balance delta: -30)
Entry 2: Debit  wallet:user_123:reserved 30  (balance delta: +30)
```

**Result:** Available = 20, Reserved = 30, Total still 50

#### Capture (30 tokens from reservation)

```ruby
TokenLedger::Manager.capture(reservation_id: reservation_id, description: "API call succeeded")
```

**Entries created:**
```
Entry 1: Credit wallet:user_123:reserved 30  (balance delta: -30)
Entry 2: Debit  sink:consumed           30   (balance delta: +30)
```

**Result:** Available = 20, Reserved = 0, Consumed = 80

#### Release (30 tokens back to wallet)

```ruby
TokenLedger::Manager.release(reservation_id: reservation_id, description: "API call failed")
```

**Entries created:**
```
Entry 1: Credit wallet:user_123:reserved 30  (balance delta: -30)
Entry 2: Debit  wallet:user_123         30   (balance delta: +30)
```

**Result:** Available = 50, Reserved = 0

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.0+
- Rails 7.0+
- PostgreSQL (recommended for production) or SQLite (development/testing)

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "token_ledger"
```

If you want the latest unreleased code from GitHub:

```ruby
gem "token_ledger", git: "https://github.com/stablegen/token_ledger", branch: "main"
```

Install and generate migrations:

```bash
bundle install
rails generate token_ledger:install
rails db:migrate
```

The generator creates two migrations automatically:
- `db/migrate/XXXXXX_create_ledger_tables.rb` - Core ledger tables with all constraints
- `db/migrate/XXXXXX_add_cached_balance_to_users.rb` - Cached balance column for your owner model

**Custom owner model:** If you're using a different owner model (not `User`), specify it:

```bash
rails generate token_ledger:install --owner-model=Team
```

This will create `add_cached_balance_to_teams.rb` instead.

## Migrating from Simple Integer Columns

If you already have a `users.credits` or similar integer column tracking balances, you can migrate to TokenLedger:

```ruby
# db/migrate/XXXXXX_migrate_to_token_ledger.rb
class MigrateToTokenLedger < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def up
    # Ensure TokenLedger tables exist
    # (Run `rails generate token_ledger:install` first)

    # Migrate existing balances
    User.find_each do |user|
      next if user.credits.zero? # Skip users with no balance

      TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
        owner: user,
        amount: user.credits,
        description: "Balance migration from legacy credits column",
        external_source: "migration",
        external_id: "user_#{user.id}_migration",
        metadata: {
          legacy_credits: user.credits,
          migrated_at: Time.current.iso8601
        }
      )
    end

    # Optional: Remove old column after verifying migration
    # remove_column :users, :credits
  end

  def down
    # Restore credits from ledger if needed
    User.find_each do |user|
      wallet = TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_by(code: "wallet:#{user.id}")
      user.update_column(:credits, wallet&.current_balance || 0) if wallet
    end
  end
end
```

**Verification:**

```ruby
# Verify migration accuracy
User.find_each do |user|
  legacy = user.credits
  ledger = TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_by(code: "wallet:#{user.id}")&.current_balance || 0

  if legacy != ledger
    puts "MISMATCH: User #{user.id} - Legacy: #{legacy}, Ledger: #{ledger}"
  end
end
```

## Configuration

### 1. Add to your owner model (User, Team, etc.):

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :ledger_transactions,
           as: :owner,
           class_name: "TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction"

  # Optional: Add helper method for balance
  def balance
    cached_balance
  end
end
```

### 2. Create seed accounts (recommended):

```ruby
# db/seeds.rb or db/seeds/token_ledger.rb

# TOKEN SOURCES (where tokens enter the system)
TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_or_create_by!(code: "source:stripe") do |account|
  account.name = "Tokens Purchased via Stripe"
end

TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_or_create_by!(code: "source:paypal") do |account|
  account.name = "Tokens Purchased via PayPal"
end

TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_or_create_by!(code: "source:promo") do |account|
  account.name = "Promotional Token Grants"
end

TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_or_create_by!(code: "source:referral") do |account|
  account.name = "Referral Bonuses"
end

TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_or_create_by!(code: "source:admin") do |account|
  account.name = "Admin Manual Credits"
end

# TOKEN SINKS (where tokens leave the system)
TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_or_create_by!(code: "sink:consumed") do |account|
  account.name = "Tokens Consumed (Service Delivered)"
end

TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_or_create_by!(code: "sink:refunded") do |account|
  account.name = "Tokens Refunded"
end

TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_or_create_by!(code: "sink:expired") do |account|
  account.name = "Tokens Expired"
end
```

Run seeds:

```bash
rails db:seed
```

## Data Integrity Guarantees

TokenLedger enforces correctness at the database level, not just in application code.

### Database-Level Constraints

All constraints are enforced by the database itself (PostgreSQL or SQLite):

#### CHECK Constraints

1. **Positive amounts**: `ledger_entries.amount > 0`
   - Prevents zero or negative amounts
   - Financial entries must always be positive (sign is determined by entry_type)

2. **Valid entry types**: `ledger_entries.entry_type IN ('debit', 'credit')`
   - Only allows "debit" or "credit"
   - Prevents typos or invalid values

3. **Valid transaction types**: `ledger_transactions.transaction_type IN ('deposit', 'spend', 'reserve', 'capture', 'release', 'adjustment')`
   - Only allows the 6 supported operation types
   - Ensures consistency across the application

4. **External ID consistency**: `(external_source IS NULL AND external_id IS NULL) OR (external_source IS NOT NULL AND external_id IS NOT NULL)`
   - Prevents `external_source` without `external_id` (which would break idempotency)
   - Prevents `external_id` without `external_source` (which would be ambiguous)

#### Foreign Key Constraints

1. **Immutable transactions**: `on_delete: :restrict`
   - `ledger_entries.account_id` → `ledger_accounts.id`
   - `ledger_entries.transaction_id` → `ledger_transactions.id`
   - Prevents deletion of accounts or transactions that have entries
   - Enforces the audit trail: transactions are immutable financial records

2. **Parent-child relationships**: `on_delete: :restrict` (enforces strict immutability)
   - `ledger_transactions.parent_transaction_id` → `ledger_transactions.id`
   - Prevents deletion of parent reservations that have child transactions
   - For development/test flexibility, you can change to `:nullify` in the generated migration before running it

### Uniqueness Constraints

1. **Account codes**: `ledger_accounts.code` (unique index)
   - Prevents duplicate account codes
   - Ensures each account has a unique identifier

2. **External tracking**: `[external_source, external_id]` (unique partial index where `external_source IS NOT NULL`)
   - Prevents duplicate transactions from the same external source
   - Enables idempotency for Stripe invoices, PayPal transactions, etc.

### Immutability

Transactions are immutable:
- No `update` operations on ledger_transactions or ledger_entries
- Foreign key constraints with `on_delete: :restrict` prevent accidental deletion
- Creates a permanent, tamper-proof audit trail

If you need to correct a mistake, create a **reversing transaction** by posting the opposite entries:

```ruby
# Wrong: Don't do this
transaction.destroy  # Will fail due to FK constraint

# Right: Create a reversing transaction by swapping debit/credit on same accounts
original_transaction = TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction.find(transaction_id)

TokenLedger::Manager.adjust(
  owner: original_transaction.owner,
  description: "Reversal of transaction ##{original_transaction.id}",
  entries: original_transaction.ledger_entries.map { |entry|
    {
      account_code: entry.account.code,
      account_name: entry.account.name,
      type: entry.entry_type == 'debit' ? :credit : :debit,  # Swap entry type
      amount: entry.amount
    }
  }
)
```

## Usage

### Basic Operations

#### Deposit (Add Tokens)

```ruby
# Simple deposit
TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
  owner: user,
  amount: 100,
  description: "Token purchase"
)

# Deposit with external tracking (for idempotency)
TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
  owner: user,
  amount: 100,
  description: "Subscription renewal",
  external_source: "stripe",
  external_id: "inv_123456",  # Prevents duplicate processing
  metadata: { plan: "pro", period: "monthly" }
)

# Will raise DuplicateTransactionError if called again with same external_source + external_id
```

#### Spend (Deduct Tokens)

**Safe by design** - simply deducts tokens immediately. For external API calls that need rollback protection, use the Reserve/Capture/Release pattern below.

```ruby
# Simple spend - deducts tokens immediately
TokenLedger::Manager.spend(
  owner: user,
  amount: 5,
  description: "Image generation"
)

# With metadata for tracking
TokenLedger::Manager.spend(
  owner: user,
  amount: 10,
  description: "Video processing",
  metadata: { resolution: "1080p", duration: 30 }
)

# Raises InsufficientFundsError if balance is too low
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** `.spend` deducts tokens immediately and cannot be rolled back. For operations involving external APIs (payment processors, AI services, etc.), use the Reserve/Capture/Release pattern below to handle failures safely.

### Advanced: Reserve/Capture/Release Pattern

For external API calls that can't be rolled back (like third-party services), use the reserve/capture/release pattern:

**Invariants:**
- A reservation can be captured or released (partially or fully), but the total captured + released cannot exceed the reserved amount
- Once a reservation is fully captured or fully released, it is closed
- Each reserve, capture, and release operation creates its own immutable ledger transaction - the original reservation is never modified
- Capture and release transactions link back to their parent reservation via `parent_transaction_id` for complete audit trails
- Use `external_source` + `external_id` in capture/release for idempotency when handling external API callbacks

```ruby
# Step 1: Reserve tokens (makes them unavailable but not consumed)
reservation_id = TokenLedger::Manager.reserve(
  owner: user,
  amount: 50,
  description: "Reserve for API call",
  metadata: { job_id: "job_123" }
)

begin
  # Step 2: Call external API (this can't be rolled back)
  result = ExternalAPI.expensive_operation(job_id: "job_123")

  # Step 3: Capture the reserved tokens (mark as consumed)
  # For idempotency with external job systems, use external_source/external_id
  TokenLedger::Manager.capture(
    reservation_id: reservation_id,
    description: "API call completed",
    external_source: "job_runner",
    external_id: "job_123:capture"  # Prevents duplicate capture on retry
  )
rescue => e
  # Step 3b: Release reserved tokens back to wallet on failure
  TokenLedger::Manager.release(
    reservation_id: reservation_id,
    description: "API call failed - refund",
    external_source: "job_runner",
    external_id: "job_123:release",
    metadata: { error: e.message }
  )
  raise e
end
```

Or use the convenience method that handles this automatically:

```ruby
result = TokenLedger::Manager.spend_with_api(
  owner: user,
  amount: 50,
  description: "External API call"
) do
  # This block is NOT in a database transaction
  # If it fails, tokens are automatically released
  ExternalAPI.expensive_operation
end
```

**Transaction Linkage:** Each reserve, capture, and release creates its own `LedgerTransaction` row with its own `external_source` + `external_id` for idempotency. Capture and release transactions link back to the original reservation via `parent_transaction_id` for complete audit trails:

```ruby
# Find a reservation and its child transactions
reservation = TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction.find(reservation_id)
captures = TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction.where(
  parent_transaction_id: reservation_id,
  transaction_type: "capture"
)
releases = TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction.where(
  parent_transaction_id: reservation_id,
  transaction_type: "release"
)

# Find the parent of a capture
capture_txn = TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction.find_by(transaction_type: "capture")
parent = TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction.find(capture_txn.parent_transaction_id) if capture_txn.parent_transaction_id
```

**Optional:** If you prefer convenient association methods like `child_transactions` and `parent_transaction`, add these to the `LedgerTransaction` model in your application:

```ruby
# Add to gems/token_ledger/app/models/token_ledger/ledger_transaction.rb
class TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :parent_transaction,
             class_name: "TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction",
             optional: true

  has_many :child_transactions,
           class_name: "TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction",
           foreign_key: :parent_transaction_id
end
```

Then you can use:
```ruby
reservation.child_transactions.where(transaction_type: "capture")
capture_txn.parent_transaction
```

### Balance Operations

#### Balance Hierarchy

TokenLedger maintains two balance caches with a clear hierarchy:

```
Source of Truth:     LedgerAccount.current_balance (for any account)
                            ↓
Optional Mirror:     owner.cached_balance (denormalized for convenience)
```

**Important Invariant:**

After any successful ledger write:
```ruby
user.cached_balance == LedgerAccount.find_by(code: "wallet:#{user.id}").current_balance
```

**Atomicity Guarantee:** Both `LedgerAccount.current_balance` and `owner.cached_balance` are updated atomically in the same database transaction. The `Manager` methods use `ActiveRecord::Base.transaction` to ensure that either both caches are updated or neither is (all-or-nothing).

**When to use which:**

- ✅ **Use `user.cached_balance`** for fast reads (no JOIN required)
- ✅ **Use `LedgerAccount.current_balance`** if you need account-level granularity (e.g., reserved balance)
- ⚠️ **Use `Balance.calculate`** only for reconciliation or verification

#### Usage Examples

```ruby
# Get current balance (from cache - fast)
user.cached_balance  # or user.balance if you added the helper method

# Calculate balance from ledger entries (slow but accurate)
actual_balance = TokenLedger::Balance.calculate("wallet:#{user.id}")

# Reconcile cached balance with calculated balance
TokenLedger::Balance.reconcile_user!(user)
user.reload
user.cached_balance  # Now matches calculated balance
```

**Reconciliation:**

If you suspect drift between the caches:
```ruby
TokenLedger::Balance.reconcile_user!(user)
# This updates BOTH caches from the ledger entries
```

### Query Transactions

```ruby
# Get user's transaction history
user.ledger_transactions.order(created_at: :desc).limit(20)

# Filter by type
user.ledger_transactions.where(transaction_type: "deposit")
user.ledger_transactions.where(transaction_type: "spend")

# Find specific transaction
txn = TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction.find_by(
  external_source: "stripe",
  external_id: "inv_123"
)

# Get entries for a transaction
txn.ledger_entries.each do |entry|
  puts "#{entry.account.name}: #{entry.entry_type} #{entry.amount}"
end
```

## Integration with Stripe and Pay Gem

### Option 1: With Pay Gem (Recommended)

Install Pay gem:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'pay'

bundle install
rails pay:install
rails db:migrate
```

Add to User model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  pay_customer

  has_many :ledger_transactions,
           as: :owner,
           class_name: "TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction"
end
```

Set up webhook handler:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
post "/webhooks/stripe", to: "webhooks/stripe#create"

# app/controllers/webhooks/stripe_controller.rb
class Webhooks::StripeController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def create
    event = Stripe::Webhook.construct_event(
      request.body.read,
      request.env['HTTP_STRIPE_SIGNATURE'],
      ENV['STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET']
    )

    case event.type
    when 'invoice.payment_succeeded'
      handle_subscription_payment(event.data.object)
    when 'checkout.session.completed'
      handle_onetime_purchase(event.data.object)
    end

    head :ok
  rescue Stripe::SignatureVerificationError
    head :bad_request
  end

  private

  def handle_subscription_payment(invoice)
    user = User.find_by(pay_customer_id: invoice.customer)
    return unless user

    # Get token amount from Price metadata
    credits = invoice.lines.data.first.price.metadata['monthly_credits'].to_i

    TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
      owner: user,
      amount: credits,
      description: "Subscription: #{invoice.lines.data.first.price.nickname}",
      external_source: "stripe",
      external_id: invoice.id,  # Prevents duplicate credits
      metadata: {
        invoice_id: invoice.id,
        subscription_id: invoice.subscription,
        plan: invoice.lines.data.first.price.nickname
      }
    )
  end

  def handle_onetime_purchase(session)
    user = User.find_by(pay_customer_id: session.customer)
    return unless user

    # Get token amount from session metadata
    credits = session.metadata['token_amount'].to_i

    TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
      owner: user,
      amount: credits,
      description: "Token purchase",
      external_source: "stripe",
      external_id: session.id,
      metadata: {
        session_id: session.id,
        amount_paid: session.amount_total / 100.0
      }
    )
  end
end
```

Set up Stripe Products with metadata:

```ruby
# In Stripe Dashboard or via API, add metadata to Price objects:
# metadata: { monthly_credits: "1000" }
# metadata: { monthly_credits: "3500" }
# metadata: { monthly_credits: "12500" }
```

### Option 2: Direct Stripe Integration (Without Pay Gem)

Add Stripe gem:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'stripe'
```

Add stripe_customer_id to User:

```bash
rails generate migration AddStripeCustomerIdToUsers stripe_customer_id:string
rails db:migrate
```

Set up webhook handler (similar to above but without Pay gem dependency):

```ruby
class Webhooks::StripeController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def create
    event = Stripe::Webhook.construct_event(
      request.body.read,
      request.env['HTTP_STRIPE_SIGNATURE'],
      ENV['STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET']
    )

    case event.type
    when 'invoice.payment_succeeded'
      handle_payment(event.data.object)
    end

    head :ok
  end

  private

  def handle_payment(invoice)
    user = User.find_by(stripe_customer_id: invoice.customer)
    return unless user

    credits = invoice.lines.data.first.price.metadata['monthly_credits'].to_i

    TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
      owner: user,
      amount: credits,
      description: "Payment received",
      external_source: "stripe",
      external_id: invoice.id,
      metadata: { invoice_id: invoice.id }
    )
  end
end
```

### Option 3: Without Stripe (Manual Credits, Other Payment Processors)

TokenLedger is completely payment-processor agnostic. You can credit tokens from any source:

```ruby
# Admin manually credits user
TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
  owner: user,
  amount: 500,
  description: "Admin credit - customer support",
  external_source: "admin",
  external_id: "admin_#{current_admin.id}_#{Time.now.to_i}",
  metadata: { admin_id: current_admin.id, reason: "Apology for service issue" }
)

# PayPal webhook
TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
  owner: user,
  amount: 1000,
  description: "PayPal purchase",
  external_source: "paypal",
  external_id: paypal_transaction_id
)

# Promotional bonus
TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
  owner: user,
  amount: 100,
  description: "Welcome bonus",
  external_source: "promo",
  external_id: "signup_bonus_#{user.id}"
)

# Referral credit
TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
  owner: referrer,
  amount: 50,
  description: "Referral bonus",
  external_source: "referral",
  external_id: "referral_#{referred_user.id}",
  metadata: { referred_user_id: referred_user.id }
)
```

## API Reference

### TokenLedger::Manager

#### `.deposit(owner:, amount:, description:, external_source: nil, external_id: nil, metadata: {})`

Adds tokens to owner's wallet.

**Parameters:**
- `owner` (required) - The owner object (User, Team, etc.)
- `amount` (required) - Integer amount of tokens to add
- `description` (required) - String description of transaction
- `external_source` (optional) - String identifier for source system (e.g., "stripe", "paypal")
- `external_id` (optional) - String unique ID from external system (enables idempotency)
- `metadata` (optional) - Hash of additional data to store with transaction

**Returns:** Transaction ID (Integer)

**Raises:**
- `DuplicateTransactionError` if external_source + external_id combination already exists

---

#### `.spend(owner:, amount:, description:, metadata: {})`

Deducts tokens immediately. Safe by design - no block means no risk of unsafe rollback.

**Parameters:**
- `owner` (required) - The owner object
- `amount` (required) - Integer amount of tokens to deduct
- `description` (required) - String description
- `metadata` (optional) - Hash of additional data

**Returns:** Transaction ID

**Raises:**
- `InsufficientFundsError` if balance is too low

**Example:**
```ruby
TokenLedger::Manager.spend(owner: user, amount: 10, description: "Image generation")
```

**Note:** For external API calls that need rollback protection, use `.spend_with_api` or the manual reserve/capture/release pattern instead.

---

#### `.spend_with_api(owner:, amount:, description:, metadata: {}, &block)`

Reserve/capture/release pattern for external API calls. Automatically handles failures.

**Parameters:** Same as `.spend`

**Returns:** Return value of the block

**Behavior:**
1. Reserves tokens (moves to reserved account)
2. Executes block (NOT in database transaction)
3. On success: Captures reserved tokens
4. On failure: Releases tokens back to wallet

---

#### `.reserve(owner:, amount:, description:, metadata: {})`

Reserves tokens (moves from wallet to reserved account).

**Returns:** Transaction ID

**Raises:** `InsufficientFundsError` if balance is too low

---

#### `.capture(reservation_id:, amount: nil, description:, external_source: nil, external_id: nil, metadata: {})`

Captures reserved tokens (marks as consumed). Targets a specific reservation by ID.

**Parameters:**
- `reservation_id` (required) - ID of the reservation transaction to capture
- `amount` (optional) - Amount to capture (defaults to full reserved amount)
- `description` (required) - Description of the capture
- `external_source` (optional) - String identifier for external system (e.g., "job_runner")
- `external_id` (optional) - String unique ID from external system (enables idempotency)
- `metadata` (optional) - Additional metadata

**Returns:** Transaction ID

**Raises:**
- `DuplicateTransactionError` if external_source + external_id combination already exists
- `ArgumentError` if reservation not found or amount exceeds reserved amount

---

#### `.release(reservation_id:, amount: nil, description:, external_source: nil, external_id: nil, metadata: {})`

Releases reserved tokens back to wallet. Targets a specific reservation by ID.

**Parameters:**
- `reservation_id` (required) - ID of the reservation transaction to release
- `amount` (optional) - Amount to release (defaults to full reserved amount)
- `description` (required) - Description of the release
- `external_source` (optional) - String identifier for external system (e.g., "job_runner")
- `external_id` (optional) - String unique ID from external system (enables idempotency)
- `metadata` (optional) - Additional metadata

**Returns:** Transaction ID

**Raises:**
- `DuplicateTransactionError` if external_source + external_id combination already exists
- `ArgumentError` if reservation not found or amount exceeds reserved amount

---

#### `.adjust(owner:, entries:, description:, external_source: nil, external_id: nil, metadata: {})`

Creates an adjustment transaction with custom entries. Used for reversals, corrections, and manual adjustments.

**Parameters:**
- `owner` (required) - The owner object
- `entries` (required) - Array of entry specifications, each with:
  - `account_code` - Account code string
  - `account_name` - Account name string
  - `type` - `:debit` or `:credit`
  - `amount` - Positive integer amount
- `description` (required) - Description of the adjustment
- `external_source` (optional) - String identifier for source system
- `external_id` (optional) - String unique ID from external system (enables idempotency)
- `metadata` (optional) - Additional metadata

**Returns:** Transaction ID

**Raises:**
- `DuplicateTransactionError` if external_source + external_id combination already exists
- `ImbalancedTransactionError` if debits don't equal credits

**Note:** Adjustment transactions can post to any accounts. Unlike `spend` and `reserve` which enforce non-negative wallet balances, `adjust` allows negative balances - use with caution for manual corrections.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Reverse a transaction by swapping debit/credit on same accounts
original = TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction.find(txn_id)
TokenLedger::Manager.adjust(
  owner: original.owner,
  description: "Reversal of transaction ##{original.id}",
  entries: original.ledger_entries.map { |e|
    {
      account_code: e.account.code,
      account_name: e.account.name,
      type: e.entry_type == 'debit' ? :credit : :debit,
      amount: e.amount
    }
  }
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `code` (required) - Unique account code (e.g., "wallet:123")
- `name` (required) - Account name

**Returns:** LedgerAccount object

---

## Error Handling

```ruby
begin
  TokenLedger::Manager.spend(owner: user, amount: 100, description: "Image generation")
rescue TokenLedger::InsufficientFundsError => e
  # Handle insufficient balance
  flash[:error] = "Not enough tokens. Please purchase more."
rescue TokenLedger::DuplicateTransactionError => e
  # Already processed this transaction
  Rails.logger.warn "Duplicate transaction: #{e.message}"
rescue TokenLedger::ImbalancedTransactionError => e
  # Internal error - debits don't equal credits
  Rails.logger.error "Ledger imbalance: #{e.message}"
  Bugsnag.notify(e)
end
```

## Account Codes Convention

Use hierarchical account codes for organization:

```ruby
# Wallets (user-specific)
"wallet:#{user.id}"           # Main balance
"wallet:#{user.id}:reserved"  # Reserved tokens

# Token Sources (system-wide - where tokens enter)
"source:stripe"               # Purchased via Stripe
"source:paypal"               # Purchased via PayPal
"source:promo"                # Promotional grants
"source:referral"             # Referral bonuses
"source:admin"                # Manual admin credits

# Token Sinks (system-wide - where tokens leave)
"sink:consumed"               # Tokens consumed for service delivery
"sink:refunded"               # Refunded to customer
"sink:expired"                # Tokens expired
```

**Important:** These are NOT accounting revenue/expense accounts. They track token flow:
- **Sources** = tokens added to the system (liability increases)
- **Sinks** = tokens removed from the system (liability decreases)
- `sink:consumed` represents tokens consumed for service delivery, which corresponds to when your money accounting system would recognize revenue

**Note on adjustments:** Adjustment transactions (created via `Manager.adjust`) can post to any accounts - they don't require a dedicated `sink:adjustment` account. Most reversals will post to the same accounts as the original transaction with swapped debit/credit entries.

## Testing

The gem includes comprehensive tests for all functionality including thread safety and concurrency.

Run tests:

```bash
cd gems/token_ledger
bundle exec rake test
```

### Writing Tests

```ruby
# test/services/my_service_test.rb
require 'test_helper'

class MyServiceTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  setup do
    @user = users(:one)

    # Ensure system accounts exist
    TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_or_create_by!(code: "source:test") do |account|
      account.name = "Test Token Source"
    end

    TokenLedger::LedgerAccount.find_or_create_by!(code: "sink:consumed") do |account|
      account.name = "Tokens Consumed"
    end
  end

  test "credits user on purchase" do
    initial_balance = @user.cached_balance

    TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
      owner: @user,
      amount: 100,
      description: "Test purchase",
      external_source: "test"
    )

    @user.reload
    assert_equal initial_balance + 100, @user.cached_balance
  end
end
```

## Performance Considerations

### Concurrency and Locking

TokenLedger uses **pessimistic locking** to ensure thread safety:

- Each transaction acquires a row-level lock on affected account records using `account.lock!`
- This prevents race conditions when multiple processes try to modify the same balance
- Locks are held for the duration of the database transaction, then released automatically
- PostgreSQL handles concurrent transactions more efficiently than SQLite

**Production tip:** Under high concurrency, ensure your connection pool size is appropriate to avoid lock contention.

### Balance Caching

Always use `user.cached_balance` for reads. Only use `TokenLedger::Balance.calculate` when you need to verify accuracy or during reconciliation.

```ruby
# Fast (uses cached value)
if user.cached_balance >= cost
  # proceed
end

# Slow (calculates from all entries)
if TokenLedger::Balance.calculate("wallet:#{user.id}") >= cost
  # proceed
end
```

### Batch Operations

When crediting multiple users, use transactions:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
  users.each do |user|
    TokenLedger::Manager.deposit(
      owner: user,
      amount: 50,
      description: "Promotional credit"
    )
  end
end
```

### Index Optimization

Ensure you have appropriate indexes for your query patterns:

```ruby
# For transaction history queries
add_index :ledger_transactions, [:owner_type, :owner_id, :created_at]

# For transaction type filtering
add_index :ledger_transactions, [:transaction_type, :created_at]

# For account balance lookups
add_index :ledger_accounts, :current_balance
```

## Production Recommendations

1. **Use PostgreSQL** - Better concurrency handling than SQLite or MySQL
2. **Monitor balance drift** - Periodically reconcile cached balances
3. **Archive old transactions** - Move old ledger entries to archive tables
4. **Set up alerts** - Monitor for `ImbalancedTransactionError` (should never happen)
5. **Backup regularly** - Ledger data is financial data
6. **Use idempotency keys** - Always provide `external_id` for webhook-triggered deposits
7. **Log all transactions** - Send ledger transactions to logging service
8. **Rate limit deposits** - Prevent abuse of promotional bonuses

## Troubleshooting

### Balance doesn't match expectations

```ruby
# Check actual balance from entries
actual = TokenLedger::Balance.calculate("wallet:#{user.id}")
cached = user.cached_balance

if actual != cached
  puts "Balance drift detected: actual=#{actual}, cached=#{cached}"

  # Fix it
  TokenLedger::Balance.reconcile_user!(user)
end
```

### Find duplicate transactions

```ruby
# Find transactions with same external_id
TokenLedger::LedgerTransaction
  .where(external_source: "stripe", external_id: "inv_123")
  .count
# Should be 1 or 0, never more
```

### Audit specific user's transactions

```ruby
user.ledger_transactions.order(created_at: :desc).each do |txn|
  puts "#{txn.created_at} | #{txn.transaction_type.ljust(10)} | #{txn.description.ljust(30)} | #{txn.metadata}"

  txn.ledger_entries.each do |entry|
    sign = entry.entry_type == 'debit' ? '+' : '-'
    puts "  #{sign}#{entry.amount} #{entry.account.name}"
  end
end
```
